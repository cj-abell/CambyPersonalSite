# Welcome to my personal website
## Goals
I wanted to gain some exposure to front-end technologies, since I don't typically use them in my day-to-day. As well as provide any potential employers a little sneak peek into who I am, and what I like to do.

## Tools
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- Netlify
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
